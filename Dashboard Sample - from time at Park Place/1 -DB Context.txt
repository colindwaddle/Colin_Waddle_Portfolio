Sample dashboard I created at Park Place Technologies to increase visibility on invoices I approved. It evaluates the count of invoices I did by country, by date, as well as the customers I invoiced the most (erased for security purposes) as well as a chart outlining billing durations by customer. Employed data cleaning to make the final product (formatting dates, translating alphabetic country codes into their full names) to provide visualization to cross-functional teams.
